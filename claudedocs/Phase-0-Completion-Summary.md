## Tasks Completed

### ✅ Task 0.1: Technical Spike - Diff Algorithm Evaluation

**Owner**: Backend/Systems Engineer (executed by AI research)
**Duration**: 1 day (estimate: 2 days)
**Status**: **COMPLETE**

#### Activities Completed

1. **Algorithm Research** (Tavily search):
   - ✅ Myers diff algorithm (npm: `diff`)
   - ✅ fast-diff (lightweight alternative)
   - ✅ diff-match-patch (Google implementation)

2. **Library Analysis**:
   - ✅ NPM packages identified with versions
   - ✅ TypeScript support verified
   - ✅ Maintenance status checked
   - ✅ Community adoption assessed
   - ✅ Bundle size considerations

3. **Technical Characteristics Documented**:
   - ✅ Time complexity: O(ND) for all candidates
   - ✅ Space complexity: Similar across implementations
   - ✅ Accuracy: High for all (Unicode/emoji support)
   - ✅ TypeScript support: `diff` has built-in types

4. **Decision Matrix Created**:
   ```
   | Criterion | diff | fast-diff | diff-match-patch |
   |-----------|------|-----------|------------------|
   | TypeScript | ✅   | ❌        | ✅ (via port)   |
   | Maintenance| ✅   | ⚠️        | ⚠️              |
   | Bundle     | ✅   | ✅        | ❌              |
   | API        | ✅   | ✅        | ⚠️              |
   ```

#### Deliverables

- ✅ **ADR-001**: Algorithm Selection Document
  - Location: `/claudedocs/ADR-001-diff-algorithm-selection.md`
  - Decision: `diff` package selected
  - Rationale: Best balance of TypeScript support, maintenance, API simplicity
  - Fallback: `diff-match-patch-typescript` if performance/accuracy issues

#### Performance Benchmark Expectations

No real benchmarks available from research, but expected characteristics:

| Content Size | Expected Time | Target (PRD) | Status |
|--------------|---------------|--------------|--------|
| 1K chars | <10ms | <50ms | ✅ Confident |
| 10K chars | 50-100ms | <100ms (P95) | ⚠️ Needs validation |
| 50K chars | 200-500ms | <500ms | ⚠️ Needs validation |

**Recommendation**: Phase 2 benchmarking critical for 10K+ char inputs

### ✅ Task 0.2: Performance Baseline Establishment

**Owner**: QA Engineer (executed by AI analysis)
**Duration**: 0.5 days (estimate: 1 day)
**Status**: **COMPLETE**

#### Activities Completed

1. **Current Application Profiling**:
   - ✅ DiffViewer component analyzed
   - ✅ Current processing flow documented
   - ✅ Memory monitoring reviewed
   - ✅ Optimization patterns identified

2. **Baseline Metrics Established**:
   - ✅ Current "processing": 500ms (simulated, no real diff)
   - ✅ Memory usage: ~50-90MB typical
   - ✅ UI latency: 800ms total (300ms debounce + 500ms sim)
   - ✅ Render patterns: 4 renders per update cycle

3. **Performance Targets Documented**:
   - ✅ Diff computation: P50 <50ms, P95 <100ms, P99 <150ms
   - ✅ Memory: <10MB for 10K chars
   - ✅ UI responsiveness: <400ms total latency
   - ✅ Render optimization: Keep 4 render pattern

#### Deliverables

- ✅ **Performance Baseline Report**
  - Location: `/claudedocs/Phase-0-Performance-Baseline.md`
  - Current state: No real diff algorithm (placeholder)
  - Expected improvement: 500ms → <100ms (80% faster)
  - Monitoring strategy: performance.mark() + memory tracking

#### Key Findings

**Current Bottlenecks**: None (no real computation yet)

**Expected Bottlenecks** (Post-Implementation):
1. Diff computation for large files (>10K chars)
2. Highlight rendering with many ranges
3. Real-time updates during typing
4. Memory pressure from diff data structures

**Mitigation Strategies Identified**:
- Web Worker offloading (if P95 >100ms)
- Virtualization for highlight rendering
- Adaptive debouncing (size-based)
- Memory limits and cleanup

### ✅ Task 0.4: Context7 Research - Diff Libraries

**Owner**: Frontend Engineer (executed by AI Context7 query)
**Duration**: 0.25 days (estimate: 0.5 days)
**Status**: **COMPLETE**

#### Research Completed

1. **Zustand Integration Patterns** (via Context7):
   - ✅ Performance optimization with selectors
   - ✅ `useShallow` for preventing re-renders
   - ✅ Transient updates pattern (useEffect + subscribe)
   - ✅ Immutable state update patterns
   - ✅ Real-time updates with subscribeWithSelector

   - ✅ Error boundary patterns

#### Key Integration Patterns Identified

**Pattern 1: Transient Updates for Real-time Diff**
```typescript
// From Context7: Prevent re-renders for frequent updates
useEffect(() => useDiffStore.subscribe(
  state => (diffRef.current = state.diffData)
), []);
```

**Pattern 2: Shallow Equality for Highlight Arrays**
```typescript
// Prevent re-render when array contents don't change
const highlights = useDiffStore(useShallow(
  state => state.highlights
));
```

**Pattern 3: Selective Subscription**
```typescript
// Subscribe only to specific state slice
positionStore.subscribe((state) => state.position, render);
```

#### Deliverables

- ✅ **Best Practices Summary**: Integrated into this document
- ✅ **Integration Patterns**: Ready for Phase 1 implementation
- ✅ **Code Examples**: Available from Context7 research
