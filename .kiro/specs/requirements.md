# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The diff-view application is an offline desktop application built with Electron and React that provides a GitHub-style text comparison interface. Users can paste text content into left and right panes and view a visual diff highlighting the differences between the two texts. The application prioritizes offline functionality, modern development practices, and an intuitive user experience similar to GitHub's diff viewer.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to paste text content into two separate panes so that I can compare different versions of code or text documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application launches THEN the system SHALL display two text input areas side by side
2. WHEN a user clicks on the left text area THEN the system SHALL allow text input and pasting
3. WHEN a user clicks on the right text area THEN the system SHALL allow text input and pasting
4. WHEN a user pastes content using Ctrl+V (or Cmd+V on macOS) THEN the system SHALL insert the clipboard content into the focused text area
5. WHEN text areas contain content THEN the system SHALL maintain the content until the user clears it or closes the application

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a GitHub-style diff visualization so that I can easily identify additions, deletions, and modifications between two text versions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN both text areas contain content THEN the system SHALL automatically generate and display a diff view
2. WHEN displaying diffs THEN the system SHALL highlight added lines in green
3. WHEN displaying diffs THEN the system SHALL highlight deleted lines in red
4. WHEN displaying diffs THEN the system SHALL highlight modified lines with appropriate color coding
5. WHEN displaying diffs THEN the system SHALL show line numbers for both original and modified content
6. WHEN displaying diffs THEN the system SHALL support both unified and split view modes
7. WHEN displaying diffs THEN the system SHALL provide syntax highlighting for common programming languages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to work completely offline so that I can compare sensitive or confidential text without internet connectivity concerns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is launched without internet connection THEN the system SHALL function normally
2. WHEN processing text comparisons THEN the system SHALL perform all operations locally without external API calls
3. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL not require any network resources to function
4. WHEN using diff functionality THEN the system SHALL not send any data to external servers

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want a modern and intuitive interface with appropriate icons so that the application is easy to navigate and visually appealing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application launches THEN the system SHALL display a clean, modern interface using React components
2. WHEN displaying UI elements THEN the system SHALL use Lucide React icons for buttons and interface elements
3. WHEN the application window is resized THEN the system SHALL maintain responsive layout behavior
4. WHEN using the application THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual feedback for user interactions
5. WHEN displaying the application icon THEN the system SHALL use an appropriate diff-related icon from Lucide

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application built with modern, actively maintained tools so that it remains secure and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building the application THEN the system SHALL use Electron Forge as the primary development and build tool
2. WHEN developing the frontend THEN the system SHALL use React with TypeScript for type safety
3. WHEN packaging the application THEN the system SHALL support cross-platform builds for Windows, macOS, and Linux
4. WHEN developing THEN the system SHALL include hot reload functionality for efficient development
5. WHEN building for production THEN the system SHALL optimize bundle size and performance

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to control the diff view presentation so that I can customize the comparison display to my preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing diffs THEN the system SHALL provide a toggle between split view and unified view modes
2. WHEN in split view mode THEN the system SHALL display original and modified content side by side
3. WHEN in unified view mode THEN the system SHALL display changes in a single column with context
4. WHEN viewing diffs THEN the system SHALL support light and dark theme options
5. WHEN displaying content THEN the system SHALL provide options to adjust font size
6. WHEN viewing long content THEN the system SHALL provide synchronized scrolling between panes

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want to clear and reset the comparison so that I can start fresh comparisons easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the application THEN the system SHALL provide a clear button to empty both text areas
2. WHEN the clear action is triggered THEN the system SHALL remove all content from both panes and reset the diff view
3. WHEN clearing content THEN the system SHALL ask for confirmation if substantial content would be lost
4. WHEN starting a new comparison THEN the system SHALL allow users to quickly replace content in either pane

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a user, I want standard desktop application behaviors so that the app feels native to my operating system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using keyboard shortcuts THEN the system SHALL support standard shortcuts (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, Ctrl+A, etc.)
2. WHEN the application is running THEN the system SHALL appear in the system taskbar/dock appropriately
3. WHEN closing the application THEN the system SHALL properly clean up resources and exit
4. WHEN the application window is minimized THEN the system SHALL behave according to OS conventions
5. WHEN using the application menu THEN the system SHALL provide standard menu items (File, Edit, View, Help)
